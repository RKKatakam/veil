//! The landing service (milestone S17; `docs/HUB.md` §13.19;
//! `docs/design/server/phase-4-agent-scale.md` §4.1–4.6).
//!
//! **Submitting** (`POST …/land`, and `vl push` to a protected branch): the
//! change is built and checked exactly as a push or an API commit is (the
//! same code: `sync::complete` and check 9, through `sync::push` or
//! `changes::create`), its snapshots become committed history, and one row
//! joins the queue, all in the request's one database commit. The answer is
//! a ticket.
//!
//! **Landing** (`service`): one landing service per branch, on whichever
//! server holds the branch's lease, takes every ready entry (in order, at
//! most [`MAX_BATCH`]) and lands those whose edited paths still hold, on
//! the tip, what their base had ([`edits::fast_path`]): each change becomes
//! its own snapshot on top of the one before, and the branch moves **once**
//! per batch, in one transaction. A change that overlaps is answered
//! `conflict`, never landed over (content merges are S18).
//!
//! **Protected branches** ([`rules`]): only the landing service moves them;
//! a push to one lands its new changes instead.
